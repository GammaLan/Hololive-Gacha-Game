# Hololive-Gacha-Game

This is a very basic and simplistic gacha game made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This gacha game features characters in Hololive (yes this was made in 2022). This project is made to be very simplistic in design (because of the fact that I made the game in like 3 hours)


# Game Functionality

As you get Hololive characters, duplicate characters will gather several colors to reflect the amount of duplicates you have on that character. 

# Usage

You can download/clone the repository and run the index.html file on your browser in order to play the game. Yes, it's that simple. No dependencies because I was too lazy to implement anything special.
